# Python_Mini-project

### This mini project contains 11 small assignments, which will help you get used to the fundamental concepts you've learned in the 1st week. They are divided into 2 parts:
- ***Compulsory: from 1 to 9***
- Optional: 10 and 11 (you can choose to do these questions or not)

### All of the tasks have examples of expected output for you to understand the requirements more easily. However, if there is anything ambiguous to you, do not hesitate to ask us.

### Good luck!
